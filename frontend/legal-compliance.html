                          Welcome to VelvetQuill, a community built by and for lovers of romance literature. Our goal is to provide a creative and inclusive space where writers and readers can explore the vast and vibrant world of romantic storytelling, across all its sub-genres.

To ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all members, we have established the following Content Guidelines. By posting content on VelvetQuill, you agree to abide by these rules.

                        <h4>What is Not Allowed</h4>

The following types of content are strictly prohibited on VelvetQuill and will be removed immediately. Repeated violations will result in the suspension or permanent termination of your account.

Depictions of Minors in Sexually Explicit Contexts Any written depiction, description, or suggestion of sexual activity involving characters who are stated to be, implied to be, or appear to be under the age of 18 is strictly forbidden. This includes all forms of child sexual exploitation material.

Racism and Racist Content We do not allow content that promotes, glorifies, or incites racism or racial hatred. This includes:

Using racial slurs or stereotypes with the intent to degrade or attack.
Promoting theories of racial supremacy or purity.
Portraying racial groups as inferior or inherently negative.
Hate Speech We have a zero-tolerance policy for hate speech. Content that attacks or incites violence, hatred, or discrimination against individuals or groups based on the following protected attributes is prohibited:

Race, ethnicity, or national origin
Religion
Gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation
Disability or serious medical conditions

<h4> Our Philosophy: What is Allowed </h4>

Beyond the clear and non-negotiable prohibitions above, VelvetQuill is committed to being a platform for creative freedom. We believe in empowering writers to tell their stories and explore complex themes within the romance genre.

Therefore, everything else is allowed.

This includes, but is not limited to:

Diverse Romantic Themes and Pairings: All forms of romantic and sexual relationships between consenting adult characters (e.g., LGBTQ+, polyamory, etc.).
Mature and Explicit Content: Graphic depictions of intimacy and sexual activity between consenting adult characters are permitted, provided they are appropriately tagged.
Dark Romance and Taboo Topics: Stories that explore complex, controversial, or dark themes within the genre (e.g., stories with anti-heroes, non-consensual abductions in a fictional context, or other "taboo" plotlines) are allowed as works of fiction.
Strong Language: The use of profanity and strong language within a story context is permitted.

Creator Responsibility: Tagging and Content Warnings

To maintain a positive experience for all readers, you are responsible for accurately tagging your stories.

If your story contains content that may be considered mature, sensitive, or potentially disturbing, you must use the appropriate content warnings and tags. This allows readers to make informed choices about the content they consume.

Examples of content that should be tagged include, but are not limited to:

Graphic violence
Explicit sexual content
Depictions of abuse (physical, psychological, etc.)
Strong language
Sensitive topics such as eating disorders, self-harm, or trauma

Failure to properly tag mature content may result in the story being hidden or removed until correct tags are applied.

Reporting Content

If you encounter content that you believe violates these guidelines, please use the reporting function available on every story and user profile. Our moderation team will review all reports promptly and take appropriate action.

Thank you for helping us build a safe, respectful, and creatively thrilling community.

Happy writing and reading!
