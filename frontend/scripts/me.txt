From VelvetQuill With Love 

Hi everybody

I'm a Systems Software Developer and Website Designer. 

For the past 4 months i have been working on a special community project;  an online website platform for writers & readers that's specially dedicated to lovers of the romance genre and every sub-genre therein. 
Honestly, It has not been easy. it started out as an idea, a spark, and quickly blew into an all-out obsession !

I finished project VelvetQuill last week and right now it's completely prepped and ready to officially go online ;
I'm reaching out to anyone who'd be interested in being a part of this movement!
i'm reaching out to individuals, writers, readers, and literature enthusiasts who'd be willing to make this vision a reality.

Right now, VelvetQuill is in need of 5 Founding Sponsors to partner with;
Our Founding Partners will stand to enjoy lots of platform benefits.
with your help and support we can finally get off the ground and become a true community.

VelvetQuill is a community platform where:
• New Writers and Aspiring Authors can:
  - Gain global online recognition for their works
  - Build and grow their portfolio 
  - Create and build a follower base
  - Explore and discover fresh inspiration for their work
  - Compete in and hopefully win periodic contests and writing competitions that will be held on the platform.

• Readers and Critics can:
  - Access hundreds of new short stories across different categories and sub-genres.
  - Discover and explore captivating short stories
  - Connect and interact with other romance-literature enthusiasts from all over the globe
